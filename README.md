# Probability Calculator Using Binomial Distribution

## Introduction
This app is a simple probability calculator using binomial distribution to determine the likelihood of passing a certain number of subjects based on user-defined parameters.

## Problem Statement
19SW must pass three theory subjects and two practicals in the 8th semester. Find the probability that they will pass more subjects and practical than they fail out of five. The binomial distribution uses an average pass rate of 70%. Evaluate the problem by developing a Kotlin program. Apply the binomial distribution to determine the probability that 19SW will pass more subjects than they fail out of five by developing a program.
